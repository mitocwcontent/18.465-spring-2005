Note: Students with an "A" on the midterm exam and on problem sets through lecture 16 may choose to write an expository term paper instead of the last three problem sets and second exam. In that case, a first draft of the paper is due in lecture 24, to be returned with comments in lecture 25, with final draft due two days after lecture 25.
